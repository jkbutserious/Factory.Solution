# Dr. Sneuss's Factory

#### C# and Database practice for Epicodus, 08.07.2020

## By Jeff Kim

## Description

Dr. Sneuss has just begun to spin up work in his new widget factory and needs help to keep track of the maintenance and upkeep of all the sensitive machinery. Let's create a web portal that will let him manage his machines and the engineers who are qualified to repair them.

This project uses C#, MySQL, Entity Framework, and MVC to create a web interface that will allow Dr. Sneuss to add engineers to a database and use his system to keep track of which machines that engineer is qualified to repair. Engineers and Machines will have a many-to-many relationship and Dr. Sneuss should be able to add an association from either object details page. 

## Specifications

| Behavior | Input | Output |  Completed(Y/N?)  |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| Create an object called Engineer with properties for name and a list of Machines that the Engineer is qualified to repair |  |  | Y |
| Create an object called Machine with properties for name and a list of Engineers who can repair it | | | Y |
| Allow users to create a new Engineer object through a user interface |  |  | Y |
| Allow users to create a new Machine object through a user interface |  |  | Y |
| Create a database with tables for Engineer and Machine objects using Entity Framework and code first development and database migrations | | | Y |
| Maintain a many-to-many relationship between Engineer and Machine objects via a joing table | | | Y |
| Allow users to create a new join relationship between an Engineer and a Machine from the Engineer Details page | | | Y |
| Allow users to create a new join relationship between a Machine and an Engineer from the Machine Details page | | | Y |

* Entity Framework

**To use this program:**

1. Open your preferred browser.
2. Navigate to https://github.com/jkbutserious/Factory.Solution.git.
3. Click the **Code** button and click **Download ZIP** to clone the repository to your computer.
4. Open the Windows PowerShell console, VS Code Bash terminal, or the MacOS Terminal and use the ``cd [YOUR DOWNLOAD FILEPATH]/Factory.Solution/Factory`` command to navigate to the Factory subdirectory.
5. Use the ``dotnet restore`` command to install the necessary packages on your computer.
6. Use the ``dotnet run`` command to run the program.
7. Use the web interface to add engineers and machines and keep track of Dr. Sneuss's factory.
8. Ensure that the following code is present in your *appsettings.json* file:

    ```
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
          "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=jeff_kim;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
      }
    }
    ```

9. If you have any issues running this program, please reach out to the developer or troubleshoot at your own risk.

To recreate the database using MySQL and Entity Framework Core:

_**Note**: These instructions assume that you have installed and set up your MySQL Server according to Epicodus's guidelines, as well as Entity Framework Core. For more information, see [Installing and Configuring MySQL](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql) and [Configuration for Entity Framework Core](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/database-basics-c2449db9-5bd8-4303-af8d-7ed7259f79a7/configuration-for-entity-framework-core)._

1. Open Windows PowerShell, the MacOS Terminal, or your VS Code terminal and use the command ``cd [YOUR DOWNLOAD FILEPATH]/Factory.Solution``.
2. Ensure that the Migrations folder is included in your cloned repository.
3. Use the ``dotnet ef database update`` command to apply the latest database migration.
4. Use MySQL Workbench or your preferred terminal to verify the database schema.

**To contribute to this project:**

1. Open your preferred browser.
2. Navigate to https://github.com/jkbutserious/Factory.Solution.
3. Log into or sign up for your GitHub account.
4. Click the **Fork** button to copy the repository and all source code.
5. From your forked repository, you can download or clone the repository, by clicking the **Code** button.
  * To clone the repository in Visual Studio Code's terminal, use the command

    ```git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USER-NAME-HERE]/Factory.Solution```
  * To clone the repository in GitHub Desktop, click the **Open in Desktop** option
  * To download the repository, click the **Download ZIP** option, save the archive to your computer, and extract it to the folder of your choice
6. Use your preferred code editor to edit the appropriate model and view files. New classes should be added in the Models subdirectory and should use the ``Factory.Models`` namespace. **Note**: the Factory.csproj file is a C# project file and should not be edited.
7. Use the ``dotnet ef migrations add [YOUR MIGRATION NAME HERE]`` to add a new database migration. 

    You can also export your database schema from MySQL Workbench by using the **Data Export** option on the **Administration** tab of your database, select the schema you want to export, select the **Dump Structure and Data** option from the dropdown menu, and click the **Start Export** button. Make sure to name the file _jeff_kim.sql_ and add the file to your repository in the top-level directory.
8. Save any changes you make in your code editor and use your preferred git solution to commit your changes.
9. Push your changes to your forked repository.
